# PantryPal

Do you ever open your fridge or pantry and find that food you had forgotten about is now expired? PantryPal can help by providing a simple and easy to use inventory management system for people keep track of their soon-to-expire foods. This can help reduce food waste and save you money by helping you remember what you have in your pantry. The user can log in using a Google account and view, search, add, update, or delete items, as well as generate recipes.

This project was made by students of the University of Central Florida for the Knight Hacks VII hackathon in 2024. This was our first hackathon for the 3 of us and we learned a lot about it, especially about React, Django, and MongoDB.

PantryPal is now being continued on by Sean Zarobsky.

The backend server and frontend React app are being hosted using Azure and can be used at [PantryPal](https://pantrypal.design).
