# PantryPal

PantryPal aims to provide a simple and easy to use inventory management system for people keep track of their soon-to-expire foods and ingredients. The user can log in using a Google account and view, add, update, or delete items.

This project was made by students of the University of Central Florida for the Knight Hacks VII hackathon in 2024. This was our first hackathon for the 3 of us and we learned a lot about it, especially about React, Django, and MongoDB.

PantryPal is now being continued on by Sean Zarobsky as a side project.

The backend server and frontend React app are being hosted using Azure and can be used at [PantryPal](https://pantrypal.design).
